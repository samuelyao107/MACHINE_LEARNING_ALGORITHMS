## üìÅ Folder Structure

### üîπ SUPERVISED_LEARNING
Algorithms that learn from labeled data to make predictions.

- **DECISION_TREES**  
  Implementation of decision tree classifiers for classification tasks.

- **KNN**  
  K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification and regression.

- **LINEAR_REGRESSION**  
  Simple and multivariate linear regression models.

- **LOGISTIC_REGRESSION**  
  Binary classification using logistic regression.

- **NAIVE_BAYES**  
  Probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' Theorem.

- **RANDOM_FOREST**  
  Ensemble learning using multiple decision trees.

- **PERCEPTRON** *(Note: Typically used for supervised learning)*  
  Classic single-layer perceptron used for binary classification. Its presence here may be part of a historical or exploratory implementation.

### üîπ UNSUPERVISED_LEARNING
Algorithms that discover hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.

- **PCA**  
  Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
